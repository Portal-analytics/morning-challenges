# Second Challenge

## Problem

Fucking make sales, you bitch.

Create a program that generates a gif that displays those words one at a time, in order, for half a second each. Running `node main.js` should generate this gif. If arguments are suppied (ex: `node main.js "Portal Analytics Rocks!"`, generate a gif with those words. The gif should be saved as "message.gif" in the `day-2` directory.

## Answer submission

Your submission should come with a `package.json` file.

## Hints

Check out the `minimalist` and `text-meme` npm packages - they'll help with reading in command line arguments and generating the gif.

We suggest creating a package.json by running `npm init director-name` in the `day-2` directory.

Make sure to gitignore the node_modules directory so it's not included in your commits.
