# Challenge #9  

Get ready to get frustrated. :smiling_imp:  

Today's challenge is: make this   
![Animated Screen](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-k1xgPqFLF9Me2b4tsxsHA.gif)  

What this is, is:  
1) Main screen with Text and two buttons
2) One button pushes a Modal
 - The modal has a back button that dismisses the modal.
3) One button pushes a new scene.
 - The new scene "Home" has a back button that return to the previous screen.


*Good luck!*
