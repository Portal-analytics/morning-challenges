# Fourth Challenge

## Problem

Bootstrap isn't the only way to make applications that look good. Use the React Material-UI library to make a web page that has the fields necessary to create a blog post entry.

It should have a Title Bar (http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/app-bar) a Title input, Body input, and a submit button. When the user clicks submit, send a javascript alert (`alert(message)`) with the title and description.

## Answer submission

Be sure to include all the scaffolding necessary to build the project on our machines.
