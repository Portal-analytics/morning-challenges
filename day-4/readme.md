# Fourth Challenge

## Problem

Help! Portal Analytics has no way to keep track of the requests it's recieving to build applications and is missing out on deals because of it.

Build a Contact Tracker application in React. It should have a title at the top of the page, three inputs (Contract Name, Description, Price), a submit button, and a list of contracts (displaying Title and Price). When the user clicks submit, add the Contract to the list.

This should be solved using pair programming, so just submit one branch and PR for the two of you.

## Answer submission

Be sure to include all the scaffolding necessary to build the project on our machines.

## Hints

If you have extra time, add CSS styling to make the background of the page grey and the submit button blue with white text.
