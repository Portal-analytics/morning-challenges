# First Challenge

## Problem

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Answer submission

First, clone this `morning-challenges` repository and create a git branch `firstname-challenge-1`.

Create a javascript file in the current directory `day-1` called `firstname-solution.js` that, when run using `node`, computes and prints the described sum to the console (`console.log(sum)`).

It should be runnable by the command `node firstname-solution.js` in Terminal.app.

When your program is complete, commit it and submit a Pull Request in the Github repository. We'll check over your solution and provide feedback. If you have not finished the task by 9:55, commit and PR what you have.
