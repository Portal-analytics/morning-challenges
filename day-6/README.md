## DAY 5 - Material UI

### Problem
You need to build an interface that looks professionally designed, but your not a designer. Good news, you're in good company. that's most every software developer. SO Google (you know, the dudes who made ZygoteBody) decided to help you out. They made [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). You will be using this to design a simple yet functional interface.

### The Interface

Create a single page web app that includes the following  

* A Navigation bar with title  
 * A hamburger button on the left of the navigation bar that slides out a side menu (also known as a drawer)  
   * The slide out menu can just have dummy menu items like About, More Info, Don't Click Me
 * A Title on the Navigation Bar  
* A button below the navigation bar that says "Click Me!"  
* On button click, present a modal (also known as a modal dialog) with information inside of it.  


For your title and for information for the modal, pull from [this information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Galifianakis)

### Installation

Google provides ample documentation on this platform. View their installation guidelines [here](http://www.material-ui.com/#/get-started/installation)  

We have provided some boilerplate code to get started. It includes sample Material UI Code that should run from the getgo. It was taken from the example section under Material UI github [here](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui)

As always `npm install`, add material-ui, then `npm start`

Good Luck!
