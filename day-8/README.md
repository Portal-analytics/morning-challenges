## DAY 8 - React....Native

### Problem
You've learned all these awesome tools for web development, but you want to make a mobile app and it can't suck. Actually it needs to feel like a native app with speed, native elements, and standards. You also feel the need to deploy your application to both iOS and Android app stores.  

Welcome to React Native.  

## React Native
React Native keeps all the great things about React (Same develpoment environment, HMR, and compenent style development), and it allows you to build apps that run natively on mobile operating systems.  

Today's challenge is to get a sample react native app up and running on iOS. You may extend to an Android app if you have the time. Please take a screen shot of the running app and submit that with your github pull request.

Good luck!
